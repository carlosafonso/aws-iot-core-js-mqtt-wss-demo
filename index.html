        <title>AWS IoT Core - MQTT subscription via WS</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>This sample shows how to connect to the AWS IoT Core message broker using MQTT over secure WebSockets (WSS), using temporary credentials granted by Amazon Cognito Identity Pools.</p>
        <p>Note that this sample uses <em>unauthenticated identities</em>, meaning that no authentication occurs. In a real production application you might want to use authenticated identites instead, optionally usingn a Cognito User Pool as the identity provider.</p>
        <h2>How to use this</h2>
        <ol>
